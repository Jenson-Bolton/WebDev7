            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p> a person of good moral character who holds the creation of my best work in the highest respect.
              Highly skilled web designer with the ability to apply complex HTML and CSS techniques to give websites life
              and engage users. I always make an effort to give every task my best effort, and I always value hard work.
              I believe that many people lack the discipline required to carry out their goals. I can accomplish anything
              I set my mind to and will work hard to do so.

    <p>Being able to work with anyone is a great skill to have and anyone should have it.

    <h1><a href="Coursework 1/index.html">IN0006 CW</a></h1>
    <p>This was my first course assignment, and I believe I gave it a fair shot.
      There are many areas in which I might have done better, but overall, I think I did okay for a first try.
      I also believe that this was a significant learning curve for me because I was finally able to grasp the fundamentals
      of html coding.
    </p>
    <h1><a href="Coursework 2/Homepage.html">CW2</a></h1>
    <p>This is my second coursework, and while it wasn't as effective as my first one,
      I think it's because of the extenuating circumstances that prevented me from giving the coursework my
      full attention. Nonetheless, I was still able to turn in a finished product.
