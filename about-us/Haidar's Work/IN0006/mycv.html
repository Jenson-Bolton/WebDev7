          <p>
            Having grown up in the East of London, I have been highly fortunate to associate with people from a range of different backgrounds and cultures,
            empowering me to work and contribute to successful teams.
            I was a student at Lister Community School, I have finished college at School 21,
            and I always looked for opportunities to learn new skills and acquire valuable experience.
            I am an ambitious individual who sets high standards for myself. I am always delighted to help and mentor others -
            especially those who feel isolated, for whatever reason.
            I was proud to be an ABA student (Anti-bullying Ambassador) who challenges any form of bullying at Lister.
            I was also a senior student where I was able to help coordinate activities
