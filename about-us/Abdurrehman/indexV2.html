            <p> I am dependable, trustworthy and take pride in achieving tasks to the best of my ability. It is important for me to be honest and sincere when I have been given responsibilities. I am hard working and work well with others. I am able to read and understand situations well and adapt accordingly. I am also willing to put in the extra work to get the job done well and am constantly trying to improve myself throughout different aspects of life. As well as my academic studying, being physically fit is also especially important to me. I attend the gym regularly and was also in my school football team as well as local football league.  </p>

    <h1><a href="Coursework 1/index.html">Coursework 1</a></h1>
    <p>This was my firt Coursework and I think that I had made a decent atempt, thre is a lot 
        that I could have improved on however, i believe that at a first atempt it was not a bad go.
        I also think that this was a big learning curve for me as I finally gained a good understanding of 
    basic html coding.
    </p>
    <h1><a href="Coursework 2/Homepage.html">Coursework 2</a></h1>
    <p>This is my coursework 2 and is not as successful as my previous course and I believe that this is due to the extenuating circumstances
        , due to this I aws not able to dedicate all of my time towards teh coursework howeveri was still able to produce an end product.
