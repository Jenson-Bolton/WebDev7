    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>I am a student at City University, I am have Multiple
      skills and abilites that allows me to be an Efficient
      and production employee. I have many different skills
      which I have gained from my own volunteering work
      and work experience allowing me to accumulate different
      skills. I have volunteered at
      <a href="https://www.solidaritysports.org/">
      Solidarity Sports.</a>
      
      
      I have worked for
      <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/">
      John Lewis</a>
      and
      <a href="http://www.wovenfloors.biz/">
      Wovenfloors,</a>
      as an accountant.</p>
    <section>
      
      <div><h3>Wovenfloors</h3>
        <p> From 2020-2022 I have been working here at, <a href="http://www.wovenfloors.biz/">WovenFloors</a>
          I have been working as an Accountant for this company and dealt with the
          finance and invoices of the company. This gave be me great expereince
          both technical and communication. I learnt how to deal with other employees
          and customers which was great communication and confidence boosting skills
          as well as learning a lot of technical skills which will be very useful and
          important to apply elsewhere.</p></div>
      
      <div><h3>John Lewis</h3>
        <p> I have worked at John Lewis for over a year and this was a completly different experience to my job
          role at wovenfloors. It was much more hands on and required a lot more communication and teamwork. It
          was more physically taxing but was more rewarding in terms of picking up new skills/abilities allowing 
          me to use these for other jobs.</div>
        </p>
      <div><h3>Solidarity Sports</h3>
        <p>Solidarity Sports is a child welfare charity which supports/ provides for deprived children. This was 
          volunteering however, the experience was completely different to any other jobs as I had a lot more responsibility
          as I had to handle and manage a group of children. This taught me great leadership skills and gave me a great 
          experience in responsibility.
